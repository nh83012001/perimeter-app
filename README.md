# React + Vite

### Tools

React / Vite
Serverless to deploy
Material for some light styling
Apollo Client for server connection and running query/mutation hooks

### Assumptions

Since mapbox lets you select multiple features and I didn't really want to overwrite it, I gave you the ability to delete multiple polygons at the same time. This could be improved by just sending the delete once with an array of polygons to be deleted.

### Next Ideas

- Disable the share link whenever you don't have any polygons saved
